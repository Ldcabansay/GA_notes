    "Our first topic is dynamic programming. This is one of my favorite topics to teach because it is extremely useful. Students often have some trouble with it initially, but with enough practice it will sink in and actually, they will seem quite easy once you get the hang of it. I'll do my best to show you how I solve dynamic programming problems. And, from there the key to really mastering dynamic programming is to do lots and lots of practice problems. The homework is just a start. Do additional problems from the textbook, and from other algorithms textbooks, and from other courses you can find on the web. \n",

Then, we'll dive into a variety of example problems to get a feel for the different styles of DP algorithms;- Longest increasing subs sequence (LIS), longest common subsequence (LCS) the classic Knapsack Problem, chain matrix multiplication and finally, we'll look at a few shortest path algorithms using DP."

First, we'll deal with the base cases. The first two Fibonacci numbers are zero and one. In general, we'll utilize the recursive definition of the Fibonacci numbers. We will recursively compute the n minus first, and n minus second Fibonacci number. And we'll return the sum of those two. This completes the definition of our algorithm. \n",

In this approach, you use a hash table or some other similar structure to keep track of which sub-problems that have already been solved, so that you don't recompute those problems. Now, we're not going to use this at all in our course. This approach is called **memoization**. Try to say that five times, I can't and therefore we're not going to use it in this class. But actually, the real reason why we're not using it, is because the goal of this unit is to learn dynamic programming.\n",

And for `5, 7, 4`; then `5, 7` is still the longest and we add on `-3`, but still length 2 is the longest, for 9, we can appended on to the longest solution, and we get the length 3.

It cannot get appended on to 10 either. But the others allow it to be appended on to the end. \n",

We just have to know, it's of length four and it ends at five and then we can append 8 on to the end. We obtain the sequence of length five, therefore, L(10)=5. Now, this highlights the recurrence for the solution of L of i, in terms of smaller subproblems L(1) through L(i-1).\n",

Now that earlier subsequence allows us to append $a_i$ onto the end of it only if $a_j$ is strictly smaller than $a_i$. So you only want to consider j's where $a_j$ is strictly smaller than $a_i$. And then we can take that earlier subsequence ending at $a_j$ and append $a_i$ onto the end of it and we get L(j) for that earlier subsequence plus 1 for $a_i$.

That's exactly what we did here, we added the extra condition, that the sub-problem has to include a i itself. Okay? And then, you strengthen the inductive hypothesis and you prove that stronger statement. And that's what we're doing here. We're giving you an algorithm for this stronger problem. We're finding, in length, the longest increasing sub-sequence with the specific character at the end.

Our first attempt is always to try this same problem on a prefix of an input. So it's key. It's just identical to the original problem and it's just on a prefix.

And now, in this case, there are three possibilities to consider. As in the unequal case, we can either not include $X_i$ in the optimal solution, in which case we drop $X_i$ or we drop $Y_j$. Notice actually those two are the same in this scenario because $X_i$ and $Y_j$ are the same. So we're dropping $X_i$ we're also dropping $Y_j$.

Now, in the first case, where we drop $X_i$ noticed that L(i, j) is equal to L(i-1, j), where we just dropped $X_i$ from the solution, just like in the unequal case. Similarly, when we drop $Y_j$, L(i, j) equals L(i, j-1). Now, the interesting case which didn't exist before in the unequal case is that the optimal solution ends in this common character. And in this case, L(i, j) is one plus, the one is for the common character that were pending on the end and then, we're going to take the optimal solution which drops $X_i$ and $Y_j$ from there and we take the optimal solution to these smaller prefixes. So this is L of i minus one and j minus one. We take the length of that optimal solution for that smaller problem, add one for this common character which we append at the end and that gives us the length of the longest common sub sequence in this new sub problem.\n",

Any sub sequence which occurs in that smaller prefix of Y, also is a sub sequence in this larger prefix of Y, okay? It's a super sign of it.

Therefore, they take order n total time. Then we have a for loop of size order n and a nested for loop of a size order n and inside it takes order one time. So the total time is order n square with these nested for loops and the total run time of our algorithm is dominated by the order n square, so we get order n square total time. This completes the dynamic programming algorithm for the longest common subsequence problem. The interesting thing that arose in this solution was that we needed to use a two dimensional table.

    "## 33 DP1 Practice Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, I suggest you try some practice dynamic programming problems. There are a lot of great practice problems in the Dasgupta book. Let me suggest a few problems for you. Now, these are problems from the textbook Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, Vazirani. This problem 6.1, which is about finding a contiguous sequence of maximum sum. Now, note a contiguous subsequence is the same as a substring. Now, whenever I sign you a homework problem, I'm always going to tell you some little blurb about what the problem is about, so you can identify it. Because, some of the online versions of this textbook have different numbering. So, you should always make sure it's the correct problem, if you have an online version. The next problem is 6.2 where you're planning a trip and you want to figure out the hotel stops to minimize the penalty. Problem 6.3 is about yuck Donald's. In 6.4, you're given a string and you wanted to see if you can break up that string into a set of words. Now, 6.11 is longest common subsequence. We already did that in this lecture, but for practice, you might try the variant where you did the longest common substring. It's useful to look at how dynamic programming solutions vary. What's the difference when you have substring versus subsequences? Once again, at this point, you should be able to do these practice problems: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.11, or this variant of 6.11 where you do substrings instead of subsequences. Let me give you a quick summary of the approach we used for designing a dynamic programming algorithm. And you can implement this approach when you try these practice problems. The first step is to define the subproblem in words. How do you do that? Well, you'd take the same problem, the original problem, on a prefix of the input. So, the subproblem should be of the same form as the original problem, but instead of being an input of length N try it on a prefix of the input. So, an input of length I. The second step is to define a recurrence relation. If you have a one dimensional table, then you wanna express T of I or the Ith entry of this one dimensional table in terms of smaller subproblems, T 1 through T I minus 1. This is what we did for LCS, though in that case, it was a two dimensional table. Now, when we did LIS, Longest Increasing Subsequence, we were unable to do this. And what we needed to do was strengthen the subproblem. So, we had to go back and redefine the subproblem. So, we've strengthen the subproblem by adding the constraint. Typically, we add the constraint that the last element, element I, is required to be included in this solution to this subproblem. So, for LIS, we said, LFI was the longest increasing subsequence in the prefix of the input of size I. But the last element A I had to be included in that solution. Now, one thing to keep in mind is typically, when we add in this constrain, and the final output is no longer the last element in the table, but instead we're going to have to do a max or a min. But we're going to have to go over the whole table and look for the best, the optimal solution in the table. Now, I want to show you how I solve these practice problems. So, I'm going to show you how I approach this problem 6.1. But to get the most out of it, I suggest that you try the problem first, and then if you're having difficulty, you can watch the next slide to see how to solve it."

    "The input to this problem is a_1 through a_n. Our goal is to find the contiguous sub-sequence. Noticed, that a contiguous subsequence is the same as a substring, and we want to find the substring with maximum sum. Now, the first step is to define the subproblem in words. I'm going to try the same problem on a prefix of the input. So, we have a parameter i, which is the length of the prefix. So, we have an i, and this is going to vary between zero and n. And now, I'm going to find s of i, in words, first off. It's going to be the max sum that I can obtain. The same format as the original problem. But, instead of considering the whole input, and I'm going to consider the first i numbers. So, it's a max sum from a substring of a_1 through a_i. So it's the first i characters of the input. Now, we want to try to find a recurrence relation, we want to express s of i in terms of s_1 through s_i minus one, smallest subproblems. Let's take s of i minus one, is the max sum that we can obtain from a substring of a_1 through a_i minus one. So, let's take that sum. Now, there's two possibilities that I would consider. Either, or add on, a_i on to the end of it or not. First off, can I add on a_i on to the end of this solution? Well, I have to maintain that it's a substring, that is contiguous. I don't know where this one ends, so, I don't know whether I can add on a_i unto the end of this solution. So, I need to know where this one ends. With this current definition, there's no way, I don't know how to express s of i in terms of the smaller subproblems. But I notice, that if I knew where this solution ended at, so, if it included a of i minus one, then, I know that if it includes a_i minus one then I can add on a_i and maintain that it's a substring. So, I have to go back and strengthen my subproblem definition."

    "Here's a solution to problem 6.1. Let's reformulate our subproblem using our insight we just gained. We wanted to add the extra condition that the subproblem had to include a_i. So we define s of i as a max sum which we can obtain from a substring of a_1 through a_i with the extra restriction that a_i has to be included in that substring. Now, we will be able to re-express a recurrence for s of i. First off, let's handle the base case; that's i equals zero. What's s of zero? Well, we have the empty string, so that's, of course, zero. Now, let's look at s of i for i at least one. Well, we are required to use a_i, so let's add an a_i. So by including a_i, this sum is at least a_i plus where do we append onto it? Well, there are two possibilities; either we just use a_i by itself or we append it on to the longest substring from a_1 through a_i minus one and we're going to take the best of those two possibilities. So if we have a_i by itself, then we get zero for the rest, for a_1 through a_i minus one, or if we take the optimal substring for a_1 through a_i minus one, what's the sum from that? Well, it's s of i minus one and we're going to take the best of these two scenarios. Now, clearly if this is negative, then we're going to just use a_i by itself, and if this is positive, then we're going to take this solution and append on a_i to it. So this gives us the recurrence, it's easy to fill the table by going from i equals zero up to n. What's the final output of the algorithm? It's not necessarily s of n because that's the longest the maximum sum from a substring which includes a_n. But we're just looking for the maximum sum we can obtain from any substring, we don't care what the last character is. So, we need to try all possibilities for the last character or number. So we do a max over i of s of i. So we take our one-dimensional table and we look for the max entry in that table and that's the output. And what's the running time of this algorithm? Well, each entry of the table takes order one time because we just have to look at two numbers and how many entries in the table are there, and there's order n. So the total run time is order n."
